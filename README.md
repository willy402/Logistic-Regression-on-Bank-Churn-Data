# Logistic-Regression-on-Bank-Churn-Data
Based on the analysis performed using Logistic Regression on the Bank Churn dataset, we can conclude that several factors such as customer demographics, account information, and transaction history have a significant impact on the likelihood of a customer leaving the bank.

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and it is found that the model has an accuracy of approximately 80% on the test dataset.

The insights gained from this analysis can help the bank to identify customers who are likely to churn and take appropriate measures to retain them, such as offering incentives or improving their customer experience. Overall, logistic regression is a powerful tool for predicting customer churn and can be applied to various industries to identify and retain valuable customers.
